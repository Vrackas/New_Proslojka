                    API is a programming interface for developers, which allows to get quotes, information on the
                    status of accounts, and make transactions directly from ECN, bypassing the trading terminal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This interface is designed for technological integration of ECN with the products of other
                    companies â€“ for example, with a variety of trading terminals. It also allows you to implement
                    large-scale algo trading projects required by some investment funds and other institutional
                    clients.
                </p>

                <h2>API allows to:</h2>

                    <li>Make transactions.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    API is available only to institutional clients as part of large-scale projects or agreements.
                    Liquidity or quotes without bridge rental are not provided.
