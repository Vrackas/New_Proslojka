                    A high-tech bridge between MT4/MT5 and liquidity providers, it serves as a link between MT and
                    AMTS ECN, allowing brokers and their customers to take full advantage of AMTS ECN. The bridge
                    includes a service for individual trade setup through which customers can configure the orders
                    according to their preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our bridge is fast, stable and flexible, allowing for detailed configuration of different
                    parameters of hedging and overall performance. The bridge does not require a separate MT server,
                    it can be easily run in parallel with other types of accounts and handle a limited number of
                    groups. The bridge connects directly to AMTS ECN and can operate either as a separate provider
                    or with any number of providers connected to the aggregator.
                </p>
