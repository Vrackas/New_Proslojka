                    A system which automatically eliminates imbalances in liquidity providers and allows to quickly
                    eliminate imbalances of open positions in accordance with the size of the deposit and other
                    parameters, thus helping avoid stop-outs on the counterparties' accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a broker has chosen the option of using AMTS Aggregator and connecting it to several
                    providers, the broker must oversee the account load of providers and eliminate imbalances of
                    open positions. If the order is opened by a single provider and closed by the other, then the
                    client has no open positions and the broker has two positions. If this process is not regulated,
                    it may gradually cause uncontrollable situation and possible stop-outs in a broker’s account.

                    Some companies use an order closing model from the same provider who opened the orders, though
                    this option has several drawbacks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the performance is not impaired, the broker loses profit by closing at the same provider,
                        unless the latter offers a better price;
                    </li>
                    <li>Statistics of customer slippage will be worse since orders are often closed not at the best
                        price, and customer loyalty will decline;
                    </li>
                    <li>Regulated jurisdictions require execution according to the principle of "Best execution",
                        and closing orders not at the best price breaks this principle, which may lead to fines;
                    </li>
                    <li>Companies prefer not to donate large sums of money.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We offer our system which automatically eliminates imbalances, free of charge. Imbalances are
                    eliminated by shifting the provider’s priorities, without any additional costs.
